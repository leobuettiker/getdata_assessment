Hi, in this course project you find my submission for the "Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project". 

My code is in the file run_analysis.R and you find the code book in the file CodeBook.md.

If you are a grader, I'd like to thank you for your work. I would be very happy for some remarks about what you liked and where I could improve this submission in the grading form.
